### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arynn Boniface and I'm a software engineer, recent Flatiron grade and Technical Coach at Flatiron School. I work mostly with Ruby, JavaScript, React and Redux, but I'm having fun learning some new languages, too! As a Technical Coach, I pair program with students to help them debug code written in Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, vanilla JavaScript, React and Redux. I also help them trouble shoot issues with their local environments, gemfiles and package.json. I am a full-stack engineer, but I especially enjoy front end development. A large portion of my repos are the result of labs from working through Flatiron's curriculum and forking/cloning Flatiron labs in order to better help students.
